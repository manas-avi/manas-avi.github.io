    Hi! I am a Postdoctoral Researcher at the Institute of Science and Technology Austria, where I work in the Material Molli Lab with <a href="https://ista.ac.at/en/research/palacci-group/"> Prof. Jérémie Palacci</a>.
    Before this, I completed my PhD with <a href="https://berndbickel.com/">Prof. Bernd Bickel</a>, focusing on the design and control of deformable objects. 
    My projects ranged from building 3D lighting displays from folded PCBs to creating musculoskeletal soft robots with laser-controlled artificial muscles. 
    You can check out my <a href="../publications/">projects</a> or my <a href="https://research-explorer.ista.ac.at/record/20276">thesis</a> to learn more about my work. 
    I am currently looking for postdoctoral opportunities in soft robotics starting in Fall 2026, and will be excited to chat about potential project ideas!
