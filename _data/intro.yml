    Hi, I am a graduate student at the Institute of Science and Technology, Austria. I work at the <a href="https://ista.ac.at/en/research/bickel-group/">Computer Graphics and Digital Fabrication lab </a> 
    with Prof. <a href="https://berndbickel.com/">Bernd Bickel</a>. I am interested in topics related to the design and control of deformable objects. Check out the <a href="../publications/">projects</a> to know more about my research work. 
    I am looking for **Postdoc** opprotunity in Fall 2025 and I am very happy to discuss potential project ideas for it!
