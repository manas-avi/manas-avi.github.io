## Add a new publication

To add a new publication, create a new file with extension `.md` in
`_publications/YEAR/` (note the underscore). The naming convention is to use the first letter of each word in the title of the publication. For instance, if the name of the publication is *Parameterization with  Coordinates* the filename should be `PwC.md`.
