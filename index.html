<h2>About me </h2>


Hi, I am Manas Bhargava and I am a graduate student at the Institute of Science and Technology, Austria. 
I work at the <a href="https://ista.ac.at/en/research/bickel-group/">Computer Graphics and Digital Fabrication lab </a> 
with Prof. <a href="https://berndbickel.com/">Bernd Bickel</a>. 
I am interested in topics related to the design and control of deformable objects. Check out the <a href="../publications/">projects</a> to know more about my research work. 
If you are master student and would like to work with us on your master thesis, checkout the projects listed <a href="https://cdl.ethz.ch/projects/">here</a>
